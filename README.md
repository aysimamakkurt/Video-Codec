# Video-Codec

## Overview
This project involves the implementation and experimentation of a video codec. The codec is a hybrid video encoder that includes both Intra and Inter coding modes, GOP structures, and rate-distortion optimization. The project also explores the use of global variables, efficient workflows, and the development of functions for INTRA and INTER image coding.

## Key Features
- **JPEG-like Encoding**: The video codec implements a form of encoding similar to JPEG.
- **Motion-Compensated Temporal Prediction**: This feature is used to improve the efficiency of the video codec.
- **Rate-Distortion Optimized Mode Selection**: The codec uses rate-distortion optimization for selecting the coding mode.

## Implementation
The project emphasizes the importance of completing functions for INTRA and INTER image coding. It also highlights the use of global variables for efficient parameter exchange. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the codec.
